This is a very simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) web app to track my swim sets in an Endless Pool. It's hard to track how long I've swam when using an Endless Pool, so this app helps me keeps a tally of how many sets I've swam, for how long, and at what pace. After my workout I can copy these details and paste them into a workout log, Strava notes, etc.

* Open SwimSetter on your phone. Put it in a waterproof pouch or bag, and leave it on the side of the pool.
* Start a timer or a stopwatch on your watch.
* Swim!
* Whenever you stop, tap the "Add Set" button and record the time and pace.
* When you're done, copy the details from the app and paste them into your workout log, Strava activity, etc.
