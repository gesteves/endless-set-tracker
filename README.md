This is a very simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) web app to track my swim sets in an Endless Pool. It's hard to track how long I've swam when using an Endless Pool, so this app helps me keeps a tally of how many sets I've swam, for how long, and at what pace. After my workout I can copy these details and paste them into a workout log, Strava notes, etc.
